# The Cancer Imaging Archive API Requester
[Not active]

The cancer imaging archive can provide some useful public datasets for experimenting with e.g. deep learning for medical diagnostics. The downside is that the data is hard to obtain if you are on a linux machine, thus the tcia-api-requester. Use this wrapper to fetch any publically available dataset that includes the modalities MR, CT and PET.
